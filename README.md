# Noddus

## Introduction

Noddus exercise was based on provided _screenshots_ which represent different sections of a page. The task was to match the provided 'design' as much as possible.

I followed the recommendations written in the attached pdf and I also had in mind UX/UI principles, so I tried to improve some of the sections without changing the required look and feel much.

## Way of working
&nbsp;
### 1. CSS
I did not use any framework, just pure CSS to keep the code clean.

In terms of media-queries two breakpoints were used:
- 840px
- 480px

&nbsp;
### 2. JavaScript
Vanilla JavaScript was used to keep the code as clean as possible.

There are separated JS files for better organization / understanding of a code.

&nbsp;
### 3. Typographies
As per reference sent via screenshots, I chose similar fonts from Google Fonts.
- Merriweather like serif
- Inter like sans serif

&nbsp;
### 4. Colors
- primary (accent): `#E51522`
- secondary: `#0A0A0A`

&nbsp;
### 5. Icons
Font Awesome was used as the only icons resource in this project to maintain consistency.

## Sections details
&nbsp;
### Desktop

#### - Header
##### -- Search box
&nbsp;
In a search box, the available items show up depending on the input provided. In other words, as you type, the available items are filtered.

&nbsp;
#### - News
The top line was changed to full-width to improve look and feel of this section - to visually separate the main content and be more integrated with a footer.


&nbsp;
### Mobile

#### - Header
Full-menu was adapted for a mobile device as following:
- vertical orientation
- text alignment and separation

For better user experience the search icon was hidden as well as quick links.
The important links as 'Registrarse' and 'Suscribir' stayed visible on mobile.

&nbsp;
#### - News
The behavior of this section was changed for the mobile to the vertical orientation to provide the user all information available.

&nbsp;
#### - Footer 
The footer was adapted a similar way as News section to ensure all links stay visible.
The secondary bottom links were hidden.
